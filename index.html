                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                      <p>Howdy, my name is Camila and I am new to the 
                        wonderful world of coding! I have a Bachelors of Science 
                        in psychology and even began a Masters program to become a counselor.
                        However, I realized early on that my passion for finishing projects
                        and perfecting functions did not translate very well to a career in counseling.</p>
                      <p>I began my journey with Codecademy thinking nothing more than some fun
                        or a new hobby might come of it. I ended up really enjoying it to a point where
                        I have redirected my career goals and hope to become a software engineer in 
                        the near future!
                      </p>
                      <p>As a child of immigrant parents, I grew up with 
                        very high expectations which has bled into my personality
                        and turned me into a bit of a perfectionist. I believe this level
                        of determination and, frankly, scrutiny, will allow me to develop 
                        these skills rather quickly. By the time any potential employers read this,
                        my website should be pretty cool looking! Stay tuned.
                      </p>
